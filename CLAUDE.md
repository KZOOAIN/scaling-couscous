## Project Context

This project uses OpenClaw with Ollama for local LLM inference, Telegram bot integration, and Cloudflare tunnels on Docker. The primary agent model is `openai-codex/gpt-5.4` (cloud-routed via the `openai-codex` provider); the local fallback is `ollama/qwen3.5:9b`, with `hf.co/unsloth/gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL` also registered. Do not assume or suggest other models without checking `ollama list` first (for local models) or `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `agents.defaults.models` (for agent bindings).

## Configuration Files

When editing JSON config files (especially openclaw.json), always validate JSON syntax after edits using `cat <file> | python3 -m json.tool` or `jq .` before reporting success. Never edit JSON files that the user may be concurrently editing without confirming first.

## General Rules

If you cannot perform a task (browser-based setup, authenticated URL access, actions blocked by plan mode), say so immediately rather than attempting workarounds that waste time. Never fabricate answers—if you don't know something, say so.

## gstack

Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for all web browsing. Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

Available gstack skills:
`/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`, `/benchmark`, `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/setup-deploy`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/codex`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/plan-devex-review`, `/devex-review`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`, `/learn`

When spawning Claude Code sessions for coding work via OpenClaw, tell the session to use gstack skills. Examples:
- Security audit: "Load gstack. Run /cso"
- Code review: "Load gstack. Run /review"
- QA test a URL: "Load gstack. Run /qa https://..."
- Build a feature end-to-end: "Load gstack. Run /autoplan, implement the plan, then run /ship"
- Plan before building: "Load gstack. Run /office-hours then /autoplan. Save the plan, don't implement."

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. The
skill has multi-step workflows, checklists, and quality gates that produce better
results than an ad-hoc answer. When in doubt, invoke the skill. A false positive is
cheaper than a false negative.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy, scope, "think bigger", "what should we build" → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture, "does this design make sense" → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system, brand, "how should this look" → invoke /design-consultation
- Design review of a plan → invoke /plan-design-review
- Developer experience of a plan → invoke /plan-devex-review
- "Review everything", full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", "wtf", "this doesn't work" → invoke /investigate
- Test the site, find bugs, "does this work" → invoke /qa (or /qa-only for report only)
- Code review, check the diff, "look at my changes" → invoke /review
- Visual polish, design audit, "this looks off" → invoke /design-review
- Developer experience audit, try onboarding → invoke /devex-review
- Ship, deploy, create a PR, "send it" → invoke /ship
- Merge + deploy + verify → invoke /land-and-deploy
- Configure deployment → invoke /setup-deploy
- Post-deploy monitoring → invoke /canary
- Update docs after shipping → invoke /document-release
- Weekly retro, "how'd we do" → invoke /retro
- Second opinion, codex review → invoke /codex
- Safety mode, careful mode, lock it down → invoke /careful or /guard
- Restrict edits to a directory → invoke /freeze or /unfreeze
- Upgrade gstack → invoke /gstack-upgrade
- Save progress, "save my work" → invoke /context-save
- Resume, restore, "where was I" → invoke /context-restore
- Security audit, OWASP, "is this secure" → invoke /cso
- Make a PDF, document, publication → invoke /make-pdf
- Launch real browser for QA → invoke /open-gstack-browser
- Import cookies for authenticated testing → invoke /setup-browser-cookies
- Performance regression, page speed, benchmarks → invoke /benchmark
- Review what gstack has learned → invoke /learn
- Tune question sensitivity → invoke /plan-tune
- Code quality dashboard → invoke /health
